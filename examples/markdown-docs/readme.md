# Markdown Docs
This folder contains an example integrating with markdown processing.

You can also build this yourself following a step-by-step tutorial for beginners, [on medium](https://medium.com/@canvis/building-a-documentation-site-from-scratch-using-airtable-gatsby-js-and-markdown-6f39df9277fd).

The public viewable base that this example is built on is available at the following url:

We have included a lockfile for your packages for both `npm` and `yarn`. This helps in testing, but you will only need one if you copy this directory. We recommend deleting the one you do not plan to use.
